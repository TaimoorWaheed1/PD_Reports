# Capitol Trades data source
> This dataset collects financial disclosure reports for Senators, former Senators current and former 
> members of the House filed from 2012 to present.

The Ethics in Government Act (EIGA, specifically 5 U.S.C. app. §§ 101-112), Senate Rule 34, and Senate Rule 41, 
require Members, officers, certain employees, and candidates to file public Financial Disclosure Reports with the 
Secretary of the Senate, Office of Public Records.    
The Committee administers the financial disclosure reporting program for the U.S. Senate.    

In addition, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (STOCK Act) requires the Senate to establish and 
maintain an electronic filing system for Financial Disclosure Reports.

- Data structure and field definitions: Huzaifa Waseem [<huzaifa.waseem@2iqresearch.com>][1]

## Data delivery methods
(TODO: Ruven + Huzaifa + Muaz need to agree on what delivery methods will be available)

#### 1. Postgres database     
    hostname: some-server.some-domain.pk   
    database: data-collection   
    read-only credentials upon request

#### 2. API endpoint    
  There is a public API endpoint that can be queried using standard HTTP tools ([place-where-the-swagger-spec-is][3])    
  Please note that bot protection is in effect - the requests will be rate limited

#### 3. S3 bucket    
  A set of files is available for delivery into an S3 bucket upon request    
  There are two main sets of files: a snapshot file with the current view of the data, and, an incremental file with    
  changes as they happen over time.   

  Replaying the snapshot files will rebuild the snapshot.

  The standard bucket's structure:

    capitol_trades
      │
      ├─── datasource-info.yaml
      ├─── datasource-info.md
      ├─── incremental

      │        └─── 20210730_235959_person_snapshot.csv
      └─── readme.md


## Data delivery frequency
(TODO: Ruven + Huzaifa + Muaz need to agree on the delivery schedule)

New data is available three times a day on the following schedule: `HHMMSS`, `HHMMSS`, `HHMMSS`.  
The daily snapshot will be made available daily at 00:05:00 UTC including every transaction of the previous day.   

## Data coverage
Coverage for Senator and Former Senators transactions starts on `2012-07-09`  
Coverage for Representatives (see `FLD0004, ReportingIndividualId`) starts on `2012-07-25` 

## Point-In-Time approach
There is no point-in-time as of now - each snapshot file contains the entire "view of reality" up until the timestamp of the export.    
If you are looking to reproduce an individual's holdings over time, you need to iterate over all historical snapshots and rebuild it from there.
